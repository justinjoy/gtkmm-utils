Recently I moved gtkmm-utils repository to github.
If you'd like to contribute something which is larger than a small
patch or two, then collaborating over github is a good idea.
Read this guide to see how it goes:

     http://github.com/guides/fork-a-project-and-submit-your-modifications

///

The text below is something which I wrote long time ago and it will
work well if you want to submit patches.

Working with git
================

When you checkout the code for the first time:

     git clone git://github.com/markoa/gtkmm-utils.git

cd to the gtkmm-utils directory, create a branch for any work that
you will be doing and switch your working tree to that branch with:

    git checkout -b mystuff

Now work as usual, committing chunks of changes with

    git commit -a -m "Your commit message."

When you're done and want to submit your changes, you need to fetch
any updates from the upstream tree:

    git-fetch origin

and then merge your commits and shift them so that they start at the
beginning of the new HEAD:

    git rebase origin

You might want to run 'gitk' to verify that all is well. Now run:

    git-format-patch

to generate a patch for each one of your commits, and email them
*as attachments*.

Obviously there's more to git than this. However, these are the basics
that should suffice in most cases. For more information, refer to the
git documentation at http://git.or.cz/index.html#documentation .
